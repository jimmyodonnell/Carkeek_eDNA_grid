Aggregate diversity metrics of each site plotted against distance from shore.
Both Simpson's Index of evenness (A) and richness (B) are shown, and have been computed from the mean abundance of unique DNA sequences found across 4 PCR replicates at each of 24 sites.
Lines and bands illustrate the fit and 95% confidence interval of a linear model.
