Distance decay relationship of environmental DNA communities. Each point represents a site sampled along three parallel transects comprising a 3000 by 4000 meter grid. Blue dashed line represents fit to a Michaelis-Menten function. Purple dotted line represents nonlinear least squares regression (see Methods).
