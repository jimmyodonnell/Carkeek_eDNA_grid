Distance decay relationship of environmental DNA communities. Each point represents a site sampled along three parallel transects comprising a 3000 by 4000 meter grid. Blue dashed line represents nonlinear least squares regression (see Methods). Boxplot is comparisons within-sample across PCR replicates, separated by a vertical line at zero, where the central line is the median, the box encompasses the interquartile range, and the lines extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Boxplot outliers are omitted for clarity.
