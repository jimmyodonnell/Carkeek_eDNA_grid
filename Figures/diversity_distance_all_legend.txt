Aggregate diversity metrics of each site plotted against distance from shore.
Both Simpson's Index (top) and richness (bottom) are shown for a variety of data subsets and transformations (left to right: mean, unfiltered mean, log(x + 1), transformed, scaled, spatially variable, and taxon clustered). 
Lines and bands illustrate the fit and 95\% confidence interval of a linear model.
