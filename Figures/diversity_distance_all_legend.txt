Aggregate diversity metrics of each site plotted against distance from shore.
Both Simpson's Index (top; A-F) and richness (bottom; G-L) are shown for a variety of data subsets and transformations (left to right: mean (A,G), unfiltered mean (B,H), log(x + 1) transformed (C,I), scaled (D,J), spatially variable (E,K), and taxon clustered (F,L)). 
Lines and bands illustrate the fit and 95% confidence interval of a linear model.
