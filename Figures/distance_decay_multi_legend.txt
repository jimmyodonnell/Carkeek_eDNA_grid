Distance decay relationship of environmental DNA communities using a variety of models, metrics, and data subsets.
Each point represents the similarity of a site sampled along three parallel transects comprising a 3000 by 4000 meter grid.
Rows of plots represent different data subsets, while columns represent different similarity metrics.
Results using the Jaccard distance are omitted because of its similarity to Bray-Curtis.
