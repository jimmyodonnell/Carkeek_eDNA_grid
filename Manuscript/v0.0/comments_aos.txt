Yo.  Here my comments.  Big picture: Jimmy, don't feel discouraged by the results.  I can feel your irritation at the paper radiating from the screen when I read this thing.  I actually think the results are pretty cool if confusing. Just a few tweaks here and there and it's gonna be good. Take a step back and appreciate that no one has tried this before... then hammer the reader with this point again and again. I usually start with profanity then delete later.

Next, I'd say be very clear about what each analysis is addressing and you will be led to the right figure to use.  I added a couple of topic sentences here and there but they are mostly suggestions that can be improved and refined with how you view the paper.

I'm also curious about the various subset analyses - do you get similar or different answers with different subsets?  It could easily be brought more into the paper if you choose a couple of subsets (say 3 or 4) and be useful to illustrate which give similar results and which give different results.

I have a few questions / suggestions about the PAM stuff.  I think you can pre-specify the number of groups in the PAM analysis, right? I'd do the analysis with 2 groups, and make the "pam_in_space" plot.  Then with 3 groups, then 4, etc.  I know the program will tell you which is the "best" number of groups.  Ignore the program: computers are dumb, biologists are smart.  There is a value in showing the patterns for a couple of different clustering sizes.  It may well be that the 3 or 4 or 5 clusters looks like it makes biological sense and we can use that.

Finally, I didn't really try and work in the distance from shore plot but I do think it is interesting.  I'll think about it some more.

Give a shout if you wanna chat.
