Hi all,

Here is another iteration of the eDNA grid manuscript.

Of note is the extensive lab and bioinformatics methods.
Both Ryan and Ole suggest these be condensed and/or moved to the supplement.
I completely agree with moving things to the supplement, but would like to keep every miniscule detail in there. 
If you have input about these, please make edits/comments towards which sections to move to the supplement, and how to reference them from the main text.
As we all appreciate, there are many, many moving parts in these projects, to the extent that we have a very hard time managing them even internally within our lab group.
At the least, I'd like to keep a full narrative for our own good, but I'd also like to make it a more common practice in papers in the field.
