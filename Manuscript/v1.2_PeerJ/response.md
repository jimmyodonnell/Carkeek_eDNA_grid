# Remove Figure Legends from Figure Files
Please remove the titles and the legends from the figure files. This information should not be contained in the figure file.

  Response: All titles (i.e. expanded labels) were replaced with letters and referenced as such in the legends. If there were legends in the figure files, I am unaware of it -- could you direct me to a specific example?

# Figure Citations
Citations must be organized, and cited for the first time, in ascending numerical order, meaning Figure 1 must always be cited first, Figure 2 must always be cited second, and so on. Please can you edit your citations and re-upload the document here <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/files/>.

  Response: We made this change.

# Funding Statement
Please remove all financial and grant disclosure information from the manuscript. This information should only be provided in the Funding Statement here: <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/declarations/#question_18>.

  Response: We made this change.

# Author Contributions

  Response: We made this change.


# Competing Interests

  Response: We did not make edits because this format is required by the contract.


# Figures
1) Figures 5, 6, 7 and 9 (if it is a primary file) have multiple parts. Each part needs to be labeled alphabetically to use (A, B, C, D, etc) instead of directions (left, right, upper, lower, etc). Please upload your figures in either EPS, PNG, JPG (photographs only) or PDF (vector PDFs only), measuring at least 900 by 900 pixels and eliminating excess white space around the images, as primary files here <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/files>.
2) Please make sure you are selecting the correct file type when uploading your files here: <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/files> (figure, table, etc.)

# Figure Permissions
Could you please confirm that Figure 1 is not copyrighted, or if it is, you have permission to publish it under our CC BY 4.0 license? Please leave a note to staff at <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/declarations/#other>. If it is taken from copyrighted material, we will need a copy of the written permission for our records uploaded as a Supplemental File here: <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/files/>.

# Remove Supplemental Files from Manuscript Source File
You reference Figures 8, 9, and 10 as supplemental figures in your manuscript, but have placed them in the Primary Files section. The supplemental files should only be supplied as separate files in the Supplemental Files section and should not appear in the manuscript source document. If they are Supplemental files, please remove them from the manuscript document and re-upload the manuscript here: <https://peerj.com/manuscripts/14649/files>, upload the Supplemental Files separately in the appropriate section, and rename them as Supplemental Files 1, 2, and 3. Supplemental Files are not typeset, they are published as downloadable files with the titles and legends exactly as they are entered into the system, so please ensure the titles and legends are complete.
