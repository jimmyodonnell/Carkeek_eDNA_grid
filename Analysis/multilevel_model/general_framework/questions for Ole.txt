Dirichlet alpha
Alpha from uniform distribution reflects our belief that DNA from each taxon is equally abundant?
Is alpha from exponential distribution more realistic?
i.e. does the distribution from which alphas are drawn reflect our belief about the underlying biomass?

Are the samples from the dirichlet simulating the drawing of eDNA? or is it after that?



what are the betas?

little p is convenience

big P is "what is the estimated proportion of species I"
betas	<- rep(0, ncol(cat_mat))

what is y? (counts_vec)
jags_data <- list("y", "N_obs", "N_cov", "cat_mat")


what is p?
jags_params <- c("betas", "P")
