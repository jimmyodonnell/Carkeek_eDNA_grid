\subsection*{Some notes about the Carkeek grid samples}

\subsubsection*{From meeting with Ole, Ryan, and Jimmy Aug 25, 2015}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Three transects are not identical
    \item Big differences in communities offshore vs. inshore
    \item Could help quantify spread/occurrence; life history variations?
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Models}
\subsubsection*{Let:}
$i$	=	taxon\\
$d$	=	distance from shore\\
$r$	=	distance along shore\\
$l$	=	location (unique site in grid)\\
$Y$	=	who knows? -- True count of DNA sequences in environmental sample?\\
$X$	=	counts of DNA sequences in a sequenced sample\\
$\pi$	=	proportions of DNA sequences in a sequenced sample\\
$\beta_i$	=	taxon-specific fixed effect; $\beta_1$ = 0\\
$\gamma_{PCR}$	=	error due to PCR variability ($\sigma^2_{PCR}$)\\
$\omega$	=	error due to environmental sampling \ldots ?\\


General relationship between Y and counts of DNA in sequenced sample:

\begin{equation}
\log Y_{i,d,r} \sim Poisson(X_{i,d,r})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Reasonable Models}

\begin{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item All DNA communities are identical
		\begin{equation}
		\log X_{i,d,r} = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \omega_{i,d,r} + \gamma_{PCR}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\omega_{i,d,r} \sim Normal(0,\tau^2)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\gamma_{PCR} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_{PCR})
		\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Only off-shore distance matters

		\begin{equation}
		\log X_{i,d,r} = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \omega_{i,d,r} + \gamma_{PCR}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\omega_{i,d,r} \sim Normal(0,\tau_d^2)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\gamma_{PCR} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_{PCR})
		\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Only along-shore distance matters

		\begin{equation}
		\log X_{i,d,r} = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \omega_{i,d,r} + \gamma_{PCR}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\omega_{i,d,r} \sim Normal(0,\tau_r^2)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\gamma_{PCR} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_{PCR})
		\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item something else

		\begin{equation}
		\log X_{i,d,r} = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \omega_{i,d} + \omega_{i,r} + \gamma_{PCR}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\omega_{i,d} \sim Normal(0,\tau_d^2)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\omega_{i,r} \sim Normal(0,\tau_r^2)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\gamma_{PCR} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_{PCR})
		\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item Exponential decay
		\begin{equation}
		??? = \beta_0 + \beta_1d + \ldots + \beta_n
		\end{equation}
